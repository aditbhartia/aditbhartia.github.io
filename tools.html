	<h1>Tools that provide step function improvements in my quality of life</h1>
	<h3>What do I mean by quality of life?</h3>
	<p>Being able to spend more of your focus on the items that you want to and less on stuff that you don't really care about.</p>

	Without further ado...
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://eternalterminal.dev">EternalTerminal</a> - I don't want to think about reconnecting to a remote session every time I open my laptop. I don't even want to be aware that the terminal is attached to a machine somewhere else. I want to open my laptop and work without having to spend my time focusing on the machine where I'm doing my work. Once I installed EternalTerminal, I had to think about one less thing regarding my workflow and could focus more on the problem I'm working on.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank">OSCYank</a> - Similar theme to EternalTerminal, but with a focus on Vim. Yanking and pasting to/from a remote machine shouldn't feel any different than yanking/pasting the way I'm used to. Having to think about whether I'm yanking from a local or remote machine and change my behavior is something that isn't particularly interesting. A gamechanger for copying data back and forth from a remote machine.</li>
	</ul>
	Let me know if you've found anything that falls under this theme! Any tool that now seems unfathomable to go without on a daily basis fits.
